> This project is a child theme of Twenty Twenty Four that showcase different ways of extending a core block.

This child theme registers Block Styles and Variations of `core/quote` block and leverage Block Bindings to customize the dynamic render of the inner paragraph for one of its variations.

The following two Block Variations are registered in this child theme:

- `Quote API Editor` - extends `core/quote` to allow it to fill it with a random quote from an API (optionally filtered by author) in the editor

- `API Quote Frontend` - extends `core/quote` by connecting its inner paragraph to a custom binding source that outputs a random quote (optionally filtered by tags) in the frontend
